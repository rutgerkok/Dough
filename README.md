# Dough

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rutgerkok/Dough.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rutgerkok/Dough)

Minecraft 1.13 removed the "Customized" world type, with the promise that those settings would come back. Of course, that hasn't happened yet. For that reason, this plugin brings at least the terrain shape settings back. In addition, some settings have been made biome-specific.
