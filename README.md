# Dough

Allows you to change the shape of your world in Minecraft. Change where and how much oceans, mountains, and valleys are generated.

The plugin works by using a YAML configuration file. From that configuration file, together with Minecraft's default world generation datapack (which this plugin automatically extracts), it generates a custom world generation datapack. This datapack is then enabled automatically.
